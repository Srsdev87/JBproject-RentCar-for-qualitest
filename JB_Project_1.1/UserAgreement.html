                RENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Israel Updated juny 26, 2017 TERMS AND CONDITIONS 2 1. These Terms and Conditions, the rental document signed by you, and a return record with computed rental charges together constitute the rental agreement between yourself and Avis Rent A Car System, LLC, or the independent Avis System Licensee identified on the rental document (“RentCar”). 2. You rent from us the car described on the rental document, which rental is solely a bailment for mutual benefit. You agree to the terms below, provided any such term is not prohibited by the law of a jurisdiction covering this rental, which case such law controls. “You” and “your” refer to the person who signs this agreement, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Avis. You also agree that you are not our agent for any purpose; and that you cannot assign or transfer your obligations. 3. Changes. Any change in this rental agreement or our rights must be in writing and signed by an authorized Avis officer. You further agree that we have the right to change these Terms and Conditions from time to time either upon written notice to you, in paper or electronic form, or upon our posting such changes on the Avis web site. Such changes will apply to rentals that you reserve after such notice has been given, as indicated by the date of such notice, if sent in written form, or the date such changes are posted on the Avis web site, which date will be indicated therein. Changes to the Terms and Conditions will be posted as they occur on the Avis web site at avis.com/terms and will govern all rentals even if the terms provided at time of enrollment are different. 4. Meaning of Car. The word “car” means the vehicle rented to you or its replacement and includes tires, tools, equipment, accessories, plates, and documents, unless othewise explicitly specified in this rental agreement. 5. Who May Drive The Car. You represent that you are a capable and validly licensed driver. You agree that we have the right to verify that your license has been validly issued and is in good standing; and that we may in our sole discretion refuse to rent to you if your license has been suspended, revoked, otherwise restricted in any way. We reserve the right to deny rentals based upon information about your license status or driving record provided by the Motor Vehicle Department of the jurisdiction that issued your license or any other reliable source in the business of validating an identity. Except where otherwise specifically authorized by applicable law, only you, your spouse or domestic partner, or, if you rent from us under your employer’s corporate account agreement, your employer or a regular fellow employee incidental to business duties may drive the car, but only with your prior permission. The other driver must be at least 25 years old and must also be a capable and validly licensed driver. There may be a charge for each additional driver authorized to drive the car, which will be specified on the rental document. NOTICE FOR RENTALS IN ISRAEL As the renter or signatory of this Agreement, you certify that you hold a valid driver’s license for the appropriate class authorizing you to drive the vehicle or vehicles described in the contract and you undertake to ensure that any person called upon to drive the said vehicle or vehicles also holds a valid driver’s license for the appropriate class. 6. Return of the Car. You agree to return the car to us in the same condition you received it, ordinary wear and tear excepted, on the date, at the time, and to the location specified in the rental document. You must return it sooner on our demand. If you return it earlier or later, a different or higher rate may apply and, if returned later, you may also be charged a late return fee. You may not return the car at a time when we are closed. If you do, your responsibility for damage to or loss of the car will continue and all charges stated on the rental document as a periodic rate will continue to accrue until the return location reopens and we retake actual possession of the car. If we do not find the car when that location reopens, your responsibility for all charges and for damage to or loss of the car will continue until the car is actually returned or recovered. If you wish to extend any rental you must contact us at 1-888-897-8448 to request it before your return date. We may or may not grant an extension or decline to grant it for the entire period you request, in our sole discretion. If we do grant an extension a different or higher rate may be applied to the extension period and a service fee may also apply 7. Where You’ll Return the Car. The car must be returned to the agreed return location as specified on the rental document. If return is indicated to a location other than the location where your rental commences, you may have to pay a “one way service fee.” If you return the car to a different location from the agreed return location without our permission, you agree to pay the “Unauthorized return location fee” specified by us. 8. Rental Charges. You will pay for the number of miles/kilometers you drive and the period of time you rent the car at the rate indicated on the rental document, or your applicable corporate rate. The minimum charge is one day (24 hours), unless “calendar day” is indicated on the rental document, plus mileage/kilometerage, or a fixed fee. We will determine the miles/kilometers by reading the factory-installed odometer. The daily charge applies to consecutive 24-hour periods starting at the hour and minute the rental begins or, if a calendar day is specified on the rental document, each consecutive calendar day or any part of a calendar day starting on the calendar day on which the TERMS AND CONDITIONS TERMS AND CONDITIONS 3 rental occurs. If you fail to comply with any conditions for special rates specified on the rental document our otherwise applicable rates will be charged. You’ll pay all charges that apply to the rental for miscellaneous services and, where permitted, airport facility fees and/or concession recovery fees, vehicle license recovery fees, other fees and surcharges. a) If you present any rewards certificates, coupons or vouchers associated with a loyalty rewards program, you may be charged a redemption fee. Additionally, if you choose to earn airline miles or other comparable loyalty program benefits, you may be charged a fee. b) You will also pay a reasonable fee for cleaning the car’s interior upon return for excessive stains, dirt or soilage attributable to your use as determined solely by us. c) If key(s) are not returned with the vehicle, you may be charged an additional fee. d) We maintain a non-smoking fleet. You will pay an additional charge if you return the car and it smells of smoke e) You and any third party to whom any rental charges are billed, such as an insurer or employer, are jointly and severally responsible for payment of all such charges. If you direct us to bill any such charges to a third party, you represent that you are authorized to do so. f) If you use a car with automatic toll payment capability, you will pay us or our toll program administrator, with whom we will share rental and all your credit card/debit card information, for all tolls incurred during your related fees, charges and penalties. You will also pay a toll convenience fee for every day of the rental once you have passed through the toll. The charges may take 4-8 weeks after the rental to be billed to your credit/debit card on file. Avis issues discount codes to individuals. By entering into this Agreement you represent you have the express authorization of Avis to use such codes. Any other use will be viewed as an unlawful use and theft of services for which Avis can pursue legal remedies, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. 9. Taxes. You’ll also pay all applicable taxes as well as any additional charges provided on the rental agreement which are over and above the base rental rate. These may be surcharges and or recovery fees to recover certain costs. 10. Card Reserve. You acknowledge that you have been informed that if you use a charge card, your credit, up to an amount of the estimated total charges due under this Agreement, as indicated on the rental document, based on your representation about this rental, may be set aside or reserved by the card issuer of the card, which you present for payment of your rental charges; or, if you use a debit card funds in the account to which that card is linked may be set aside for the greater of the amount of the estimated total charges due under this Agreement, based on your representation about this rental, as indicated on the rental document or the deposit amount indicated on signs at the location at which you rent at the time of rental. You consent to the reservation or setting aside of that estimated total amount at the time of commencement of the rental. You understand that we will authorize the release of any excess reserve or set aside upon the completion of your rental, and that your card issuer’s rules apply to your credit line or your account being credited for such excess and may not be immediately released by your card issuer. 11. Repossessing the Car. We can repossess the car at any time in our sole discretions for reasons that include, but are not limited to the following: it is found illegally parked, being used to violate the law or the terms of this agreement, or appears to be abandoned. You agree that we needn’t notify you in advance. If the car is repossessed, you agree to pay the actual and reasonable costs incurred by us to repossess the car. Youagree that such costs will be charged to the card you used to rent the car. 12. Loss Damage Waiver (LDW). Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) is not insurance and not mandatory. If you accept full LDW by your initials on the rental document at the additional daily rate, for each full or partial day that the car is rented to you and the car is operated in accordance with this agreement, we assume responsibility for the loss of or damage to the car except, if permitted by law, for lost, damaged or stolen keys or remote entry devices, towing or tire services, unless related to an accident, or recovery of the car if stolen (except in the state of Alaska) and except for your amount of “responsibility”, if any, specified on the rental document. Partial Loss Damage Waiver (PDW) is available only where permitted by law. If you accept PDW at the indicated daily rate, and the car is operated in accordance with this Agreement, we assume all loss or damage to the car up to the amount as specified on the rental document and you accept responsibility for all other loss or damage. If you do not accept either LDW or PDW, you owe for all loss or damage to the car. Loss and damage are described in paragraph 13 below. You acknowledge you have been advised that your own insurance may cover loss or damage to the car. You also acknowledge reading the notice on loss damage shown on the rental document, or in these terms, or TERMS AND CONDITIONS 4 in a separate notice form. In Canada, if you accept LDW, there may nevertheless be a non-waivable amount for which you will be responsible in the event of loss or damage to the car, which amount will be specified on the rental document at the time of rental. Currently this amount is a maximum of CA $500. Notices About Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) The following section meets certain state requirements for disclosure. Connecticut: To determine the annualized charge for Loss Damage Waiver (“LDW” or “PDW”), multiply the daily rate found on page 1 of the Rental Document by 365 days. Loss Damage Waiver covers loss or damage due to theft, collision, vandalism, or any other cause. Whether or not you accept Loss Damage Waiver, or if Loss Damage Waiver is not permitted, you are responsible for the loss or damage to the car that is caused by you or by an authorized additional driver through intentional or willful and wanton misconduct; driving while intoxicated or using drugs; participation in any organized or racing competition; transporting persons or property for hire; commission of a felony or an act that could be a felony; failure to complete an accident or theft report; use or operation by an unauthorized driver; violation of the terms of the rental agreement; operating off paved roads, use to push or tow something; or obtaining car through fraud or misrepresentation. You should examine your personal auto insurance policy, including deductible and limit of coverage, because it may cover loss or damage and personal injury incurred while you are using or operating a rental car. If your responsibility for any loss or damage is covered by your own insurance, you will authorize Avis to deal with the carrier. Avis will refund any sum collected above the amount of the cost of repair. Minnesota Consumer Protection: Under Minnesota law, a personal automobile insurance policy MUST cover the rental of this motor vehicle against damage to the vehicle and against loss of use of the vehicle. Therefore, purchase of any loss damage waiver or insurance for the risk of possible loss or damage to the car covered by this agreement is NOT necessary if your policy was issued in Minnesota. 13. Damage to/Loss of the Car. If you do not accept LDW, or if the car is lost or damaged as a direct or indirect result of a violation of paragraph 14, or damaged as a result of an act of nature, you are responsible and you will pay us for all loss of or damage to the car regardless of cause, or who, or what caused it. If the car is damaged, you will pay our estimated repair cost, or if, in our sole discretion, we determine to sell the car in its damaged condition, you will pay the difference between the car’s retail fair market value before it was damaged and the sale proceeds except in, Illinois and Canada. In Illinois, if the car is damaged, you will pay our estimated repair cost up to the amount specified by law, or if in our sole discretion, we determine to sell the car in its damaged condition, you will pay the lesser of the difference between the car’s retail fair market value before it was damaged and the sale proceeds up to the amount specified by law. If the car is stolen and not recovered you will pay the car’s fair market value before it was stolen. In Canada, you will pay the greater of the car’s retail fair market value or its value on our books of account (also known as depreciated book value) before theft or, in the case of damage, the sale proceeds. Depreciated book value may be higher than retail fair market value. Where permitted by law, you authorize us to charge you for the actual cost of repair or replacement of lost or damaged items such as glass, mirrors, tires and antenna, as part of your rental charges at the time of return. If the car is stolen and not recovered you will pay us the car’s fair market value before it was stolen. As part of our loss, you’ll also pay for loss of use of the car, without regard to our fleet utilization, plus an administrative fee, plus towing and storage charges, if any (“Incidental Loss”). If your responsibility is covered by any insurance, credit card benefit, travel insurance or such other insurance or benefits, you authorize us to contact the benefit provider directly on your behalf and assign all of your benefits directly to us to recover all consequential and incidental damages including, but not limited to the repairs of the vehicle plus diminished value or the fair market retail value of the car (less salvage value plus costs incurred in the salvage-sale), and all loss of use, towing, storage and administrative fees. If we collect our loss from a third party after we have collected our loss from you, we will refund the difference, if any, between what you paid and what we collected from the third party. If the law of a jurisdiction covering this rental requires conditions on LDW that are different than the terms of this agreement, such as if your liability for ordinary negligence is limited by such law, that law prevails. You understand that you are not authorized to repair or have the car repaired without our express prior written consent. If you repair or have the car repaired without our consent, you will pay the estimated cost to restore the car to the condition it was in prior to your rental. If we authorize you to have the car repaired, we will reimburse you for those repairs only if you give us the repair receipt. 14. Prohibited Use of the Car. Certain uses of the car and other things you or a driver may do, or fail to do, will violate this Agreement and, in addition to anything else may cause us to cancel your enrollment in Avis Preferred. A VIOLATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH, WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE YOUR RENTAL, and IS AN EXCLUSION TO AND VOIDS ALL LIABILITY PROTECTION AND ANY OPTIONAL SERVICES THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE, TERMS AND CONDITIONS 5 PERSONAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE, PERSONAL EFFECTS PROTECTION, EXTENDED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, EMERGENCY SICKNESS PROTECTION AND LOSS DAMAGE WAIVER OR PARTIAL DAMAGE WAIVER. IT ALSO MAKES YOU LIABLE TO US FOR ALL PENALTIES, FINES, FORFEITURES, LIENS AND RECOVERY AND STORAGE COSTS, INCLUDING ALL RELATED LEGAL EXPENSES, FEES AND COSTS THAT WE MAY INCUR. It is a violation of this paragraph if: a. You use or permit the car to be used: 1) by anyone other than an authorized driver, as defined in paragraph 5; 2) to carry passengers or property for hire; 3) to tow or push anything; 4) to be operated in a test, race or contest, or on unpaved roads; 5) while the driver is under the influence of alcohol and/or a controlled substance; 6) for conduct that could be charged as a crime such as a felony or misdemeanor, including the transportation of a controlled substances or contraband; 7) recklessly or while overloaded; or 8) if the car is driven into Mexico without our expressed permission. b. You or an additional driver, authorized or not: 1) fail to promptly report any damage to or loss of the car when it occurs, or when you learn of it and provide us with a written accident/incident report or fail to cooperate with our investigation; 2) Where required by law, failed to report an accident to law enforcement; 3) obtained the car through fraud or misrepresentation; 4) leave the car and fail to remove the keys or close and lock all doors, close all windows and the trunk and the car is stolen or vandalized; 5) intentionally or with willful disregard cause or allow damage to the car, or 6) return the car after hours and the car is damaged, stolen or vandalized or otherwise failed to take reasonable steps to secure the vehicle, its keys or other remote entry and starting devices. c. Driving or operating this car while using a hand-held wireless communication device or other device that is capable of receiving or transmitting telephonic communications, electronic data, mail or text messages shall be deemed a breach of this contract. 15. Fuel Service Charge. Most rentals come with a full tank of fuel, but that is not always the case. (A) Where available, if permitted by law, if you drive less than 75 miles, you acknowledge that we will add a flat fee to the rental, the amount of which will be disclosed on the rental document and at the counter prior to rental. You may avoid this charge at time of return by providing a receipt for fuel purchased at which time the flat fee will be reversed from your total rental charges. If this subparagraph (A) does not apply, there are three refueling options: 1) If you do not accept the fuel service option, where available, at the beginning of your rental, and you return the car with less fuel than was in it when you received it, we will charge you a fuel service charge at the applicable rate per-mile or per-gallon rate specified on the rental document. The per-mile rate is used if you do not buy fuel during the rental. To calculate this amount, we multiply the number of miles driven, as shown on the car’s odometer, times the per-mile rate shown on the rental document. The per gallon rate is used if you buy fuel during the rental and provide us with a receipt on our request, but the tank is not as full when you return the car as when you received the car (by using the factory installed gauge, rounded down to the nearest 1/8 tank), times the per-gallon rate shown on the rental document. Although two methods are used for ease of calculation, the per mile and per-gallon rates produce approximately the same result. Some of our vehicles are equipped with onboard telematics which record the actual amounts of fuel in the gas tank. In the event your vehicle has such a device, you will be charged for the actual amount of gasoline needed to fill the tank based on the reading of this device. 2) If you accept the fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the rental document for that purchase and you will not pay us a fuel service charge. If you choose this option, you will not incur an additional fuel service charge, but you will not receive any credit for fuel left in the tank at the time of return. The per-gallon cost of the fuel service option will always be lower than the fuel service charge. The cost of refueling the car yourself at a local service station may be lower than the fuel service charge or the fuel service option.

Disclosures Regarding Additional Liability Insurance In the State of Florida What is Additional Liability Insurance (ALI)? Avis has Additional Liability Insurance (ALI) available at all Florida locations. ALI is a special optional service offered by Avis when you rent a car from Avis. It’s an “Excess Automobile Liability Insurance Policy” that provides additional liability insurance, within specified limits, above the limits provided in this Rental Agreement. ALI insures you, and authorized operators as defined in this Rental Agreement against claims made by third parties against you, the customer, for bodily injury/death and property damage caused by the use or operation of an Avis rental vehicle as permitted in this Rental Agreement. ALI is a separate insurance policy issued to Avis by ACE American Insurance Company. If you elect to accept ALI, you will pay an additional daily charge as shown on this Rental Agreement. The purchase of ALI is not required in order to rent a car from Avis. What are the coverage limits provided by ALI? The ALI coverage limits equal the difference between the minimum financial responsibility limits, if any, provided under paragraph 22 of this Rental Agreement and the ALI maximum $2,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence. When and where does ALI coverage apply? You and authorized operators are covered while driving the rental car within the United States and Canada, but only if the car is rented and returned in the United States. Coverage does not apply in Mexico. How do I report a claim? If you are involved in an accident, you must complete an accident report and deliver it to the Avis rental location. In order to make a claim or give notice of a claim, send written notice to: Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. Attn: Claims P.O. Box 61247 Virginia Beach, VA 23466 1-866-446-8376 How does ALI affect the application of your automobile or umbrella insurance policy? Your personal insurance policy providing coverage on an owned automobile, or other personal policy, may provide additional coverage, and to that extent, ALI may provide a duplication of coverage. Whether, at what point, and to what extent, your own policies apply can only be determined by your checking the terms of the policies themselves as these terms frequently vary. However, if ALI is accepted, the protection afforded by ALI, and the limits of protection under this Rental Agreement, are primary to your own policies. This means that before your own policies would apply to pay a claim, the $2,000,000 protection afforded by the combination of ALI and financial responsibility limits under this Rental Agreement limits would have to be exhausted. If you do not accept ALI, your insurance, if any, is primary as stated in this Rental Agreement. What exclusions apply to ALI? The following highlights some of the exclusions that would preclude ALI. It is important that you read the rental agreement and the policy carefully for all exclusions. • Any Prohibited Use of the Car as described in paragraph 14 of this rental agreement • Bodily injury to or Property Damage to any Insured; nor, to the extent permitted by law in the state where the Rental Agreement is signed, to Bodily Injury or Property Damage to any person who is related to any Insured by blood, marriage or adoption and residing in the same household. TERMS AND CONDITIONS 9 • “Uninsured Motorist”/”Underinsured Motorist” coverage are not provided by the policy except in states where mandated by law up to maximum amount of $100,000 or in such amounts as mandated by law • “No Fault” and other supplemental or optional coverages are not provided by the policy • Punitive or exemplary damages to the extent permitted by law Are there any special restrictions on the purchase of ALI? In Florida, ALI may not be purchased if the term of the Rental Agreement is for more than 30 days, coverage may not be provided for more than 30 consecutive days; and if the Rental Agreement is extended beyond 30 days, the coverage may be extended for one time only, for a period not to exceed 30 days.
