        Opel is one of the largest car manufacturers in Europe. 
        Founded by Adam Opel in 1862 in the city of Rüsselsheim. 
        The company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012. Opel has a long and rich history.
        The company was designed in light of the passion for cars. Together with Vauxhall, the sister brand in the UK, 
        cars are sold to more than 35 European markets. Opel operates 13 factories in eight European countries and employs 47,000 employees. 
        More than 5,000 jobs are staffed by independent sales and service personnel.
        Opel plans the largest product line in its history and will introduce 23 new vehicles and 13 new engines by 2016.
        On-the-go models, the stylish ADAM and elegant Cascada, Seating and a convertible, are just the beginning.
